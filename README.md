# CPP-Modules

# :book: About 
These modules of C++ are designed to help me understand the specificities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object-Oriented Programming! This Project contains 9 modules every one of the 9 Modules designed To help me discover new Things in C++ OOP.

## Module 01
:mag: Memory allocation, references, pointers to members, switch.

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with:

**ex00:** Allocation <br />
**ex00:** Pointer/Reference <br />
**ex00:** getter and setter functions <br />
**ex00:** different constructors <br />
**ex00:** function pointers <br />

## Module 02
:mag:Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overload and orthodox canonical classes.

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with classes in orthodox canonical form:

**ex00:** class that can store a fixed point variable<br />
**ex01:** add constructors and functions to that class from ex00 to make it usable<br />
**ex02:** add all kinds of operator overloads to expand the usability of ex01 even more<br />

## Module 03
:mag:Inheritance

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with inheritance for classes:

**ex00:** creation of the base class to inherit from<br />
**ex01:** inherits from base class and adds new values to the attributes as well as a new function<br />
**ex02:** inherits from base class and adds new values to the attributes as well as a new function<br />

## Module 04
:mag:Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.

ex00: Polymorphism<br />
ex01: creation of deep copies of classes<br />
ex02: introduction of the abstract class<br />

## Module 05
:mag:Repetition and exceptions.

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in closer contact with inheritance for classes:

**ex00:** Introduction to exceptions<br />
**ex01:** Further use of exceptions<br />
**ex02:** Combination of abstract classes and exceptions<br />
**ex03:** Usage of the abstract class from within a class<br />

## Module 06
:mag: C++ casts.

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in closer contact with inheritance for classes:

**ex00:** Introduction to static casting and conversion of scalar types<br />
**ex01:** Serialization and reinterpret casting<br />
**ex02:** Identification of real types of classes via dynamic casting<br />

## Module 07
:mag:C++ templates.

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in closer contact with inheritance for classes:

**ex00:** Introduction to function templates<br />
**ex01:** Further use of function templates<br />
**ex02:** Use of class templates<br />

## Module 08
:mag:Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in closer contact with inheritance for classes:

**ex00:** Introduction to algorithms and iterators combined with templates<br />
**ex01:** Further use of algorithms and iterators with classes<br />
**ex02:** Making the std::stack container iterable<br />

**Usage:** All exercises can be compiled from the root of the exercise with **make** or **make re**.
All exercises have a main function to demonstrate all the abilities of the subject.
After that, run the created executable like **./executable_to_run**

## Module 09
:mag:Namespace, class, member functions, stdio stream, initialization lists, static, const and lots of basic stuff.

**ex00:**
The Goal of this exercise was to write a really simple c++ style programm, but without any classes yet, just to get familiar with the use of i.e. std::cout.<br />
**Usage:** You can compile this project with make, make all or make re. Then use it with ./megaphone "Argument_you_want_to_change_to_all_CAPS"

**ex01:**
This programm resembles a phonebook, where you can store up to 8 contacts, and display the stored information during runtime.
When the programm is terminated in any way, all contacts are lost.
The phonebook also has instructions and descriptive error messages that tell you what to do and how to use it correctly.

**Usage:**
You can compile this project with **make** or **make re**.
Then you can run it with **./phonebook**.
